# LLaMA 2 and QLoRA Overview

## LLaMA 2

### Introduction
LLaMA 2 (Large Language Model Meta AI 2) is an advanced language model developed by Meta (formerly Facebook). It is a successor to the original LLaMA model with significant enhancements and improvements. 

### Key Features
- **Improved Capabilities**: Enhanced performance in text generation, summarization, translation, and more.
- **Architecture**: Builds upon the transformer architecture with increased parameters and optimized training techniques.
- **Training Data**: Trained on a diverse and extensive dataset for better generalization across different domains.
- **Applications**: Suitable for content creation, chatbots, virtual assistants, and complex NLP tasks.

## QLoRA

### Introduction
QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique designed to fine-tune large language models more efficiently. It combines quantization and low-rank adaptation to reduce computational requirements without significantly compromising performance.

### Key Features
- **Quantization**: Reduces the precision of the model weights to lower-bit formats (e.g., 8-bit or 4-bit), decreasing model size and computational load.
- **Low-Rank Adaptation**: Decomposes the model's weight matrices into lower-dimensional matrices, allowing efficient fine-tuning.
- **Efficiency**: Enables fine-tuning with less memory and computational power.
- **Applications**: Ideal for scenarios with limited computational resources, such as on-device inference.

# Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)

### Project Overview
Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained language model to perform specific tasks by training it on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This process enhances the model's performance on particular applications, making it more accurate and relevant for the desired task.

### Steps in Fine-Tuning
1. **Select a Pre-Trained Model**: Choose a model that suits your task, such as GPT-3, BERT, or LLaMA.
2. **Prepare the Dataset**: Gather and preprocess a task-specific dataset. The dataset used for this project was of 10000 rows taken from hugging face site https://huggingface.co/datasets/timdettmers/openassistant-guanaco
3. **Configure Training**: Set up the loss function, optimizer, and learning rate for the task to fine tune it.
4. **Fine-Tune the Model**: Train the pre-trained model on the task-specific dataset. My fine tuned data set of 1000 rows is thus prepared.  https://huggingface.co/datasets/anushkawwwwp/guanaco-llama2-1k/tree/main
5. **Evaluate and Iterate**: Assess the model's performance and refine the process as needed.

### Benefits
- **Customization**: Tailors the model to specific needs, enhancing effectiveness.
- **Efficiency**: Saves time and resources compared to training from scratch.
- **Improved Performance**: Increases accuracy and relevance for specialized tasks.

# Fine-Tuning with Hugging Face Data

### Process
1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure necessary libraries (`transformers`, `datasets`, `torch`) are installed.
2. **Load Dataset**: Use the `datasets` library to load a dataset from Hugging Face.
3. **Preprocess Data**: Tokenize and preprocess the data for fine-tuning.
4. **Select Subset**: Choose 10,000 rows from the dataset.
5. **Fine-Tune Model**: Configure and train the model on the selected data.
6. **Generate Responses**: Use the fine-tuned model to generate 1,000 responses.

### Example Workflow (Theory)
- **Setup**: Install `transformers` and `datasets`.
- **Loading Dataset**: Load a dataset such as IMDB from Hugging Face.
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenize the text data, ensuring it fits the model's requirements.
- **Data Selection**: Randomly select 10,000 rows from the preprocessed dataset.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Load a pre-trained model, set training parameters, and fine-tune on the selected data.
- **Response Generation**: Use the fine-tuned model to generate responses, tailored to the specific task.

### Practical Applications
- **Text Classification**: Improve accuracy on specific categories or sentiments.
- **Text Generation**: Generate domain-specific content, maintaining context and relevance.
- **Summarization**: Provide concise summaries of large documents tailored to specific needs.
